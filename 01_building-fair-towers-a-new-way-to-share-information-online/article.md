In the vast playground of the internet, big tech companies have been monopolizing the best building blocksâ€”information. This situation has created an imbalance that needs addressing, as current content moderation practices and algorithms shape what millions see when they log on.

Currently, companies like Google and Facebook dictate how information is organized, prioritizing their ad revenue over fair access for content creators. This model leaves creators in a tough spot, as they struggle to determine the true value of their work. The European Union has recognized this issue and enacted new regulations that threaten tech companies with fines of up to 6% of their revenue if they fail to prevent election meddling on their platforms.

Smart thinkers propose a new set of rules that would help everyone understand the value of each piece of information. The EU regulatory framework on content moderation is increasingly complex and has been differentiated by category of the online platform and the type of content.

By assigning unique tags to every piece of content, users would be able to build their own structures of information without relying solely on the big players. This new system would empower content creators by giving them credit for their contributions and allowing users to maintain ownership of their data and relationships online. The main challenges relate to the large quantity of content on platforms as well as the fragmentation of laws and practices regarding content moderation across Member States.

Imagine a world where you and your friends can build your own towers without being dependent on the big kids. This approach could lead to a more equitable and enjoyable online environment for everyone. However, as Evelyn Douek has pointed out, we need to focus on the overall system, not just individual decisions that catch our attention.

By implementing these changes, we can create a fairer internet where all voices are heard and valued. The Digital Services Act (DSA) suggests a focus on overall processes and does not treat errors as evidence of lawbreaking.

This approach could foster creativity and collaboration while addressing the concerns raised by critics who argue that governmental actions infringe upon free speech.
The time for change is now. As we move forward, we must consider the complex nature of human communication and the continuous evolution of online content. As Princeton University Computer Science professor Arvind Narayanan highlights, the audience who hears our online expressions is significantly influenced by algorithms.
By addressing these challenges, we can work towards an internet where everyone has the opportunity to shine, while still maintaining the safeguards necessary for a healthy online ecosystem.
