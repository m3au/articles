# The importance of unit tests

Video URL: [YOU DON\'T UNIT TEST??? DevHour #1 Theot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvBHyip4peo&t=209s)

The video discusses the argument between unit testing and user-driven development, highlighting the speaker's belief in the importance of unit testing for code confidence and refactoring. They argue that unit tests are not always necessary in certain contexts like building user-first software and cite examples of production issues that could not have been caught by integration tests. Additionally, they discuss the potential drawbacks of hooks in React and the impact on performance due to generating throwaway objects during renders.

## Highlights

- Emphasis on code confidence and refactoring through unit testing
- Argument against test-driven development (TDD) in favor of user-driven development (UDD)
- Discussion on the drawbacks of unit testing in certain contexts
- Example of a production issue that could not have been caught by integration tests
- Perspective on rebuilding code versus relying on tests
- Importance of mentorship and communication for new developers
- 100% test coverage is garbage

## Take Aways

- Git rebase is a lie
- UDD or BDD is the way to go (safety net of integration tests)
- Financial calculations and backend services require unit tests
- Unit tests are not always necessary
- Production issues can still occur despite integration tests
- Refactoring is key to code quality
- Mentorship and communication are crucial for new developers
- 100% test coverage is not a realistic goal
