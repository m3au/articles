Climate change is increasingly impacting critical infrastructure globally. The growing intensity and frequency of climate disasters pose significant threats to societies and ecosystems. During the 2019-2020 period, many communities experienced overwhelming challenges, with smoke filling urban areas, firestorms devastating homes, and wildlife habitats being destroyed. This situation fostered a pervasive sense of panic and urgency.

## Government Responses and Risk Management

In response to these challenges, governments have initiated revisions to fire ratings and developed strategies for effective risk management. Public education on disaster preparedness has become a priority, as communities must be equipped to respond to these evolving threats. We can anticipate that similar conceptual revisions will occur across various sectors in the near future. Federal government accountability and risk assessment responsibilities are increasingly overlapping among multiple agencies, including those focused on defense, environmental protection, and disaster recovery.

## The Need for Interagency Cooperation

Greater interagency cooperation is essential for addressing these complex systemic issues. The expansion of departments responsible for home affairs has made progress in tackling these interconnected challenges. As we look ahead, we will likely see an escalation in risks that converge between natural disasters and technological threats.

## Lessons from Recent Events

The events of 2020 underscored the importance of rapid responses to constant change. The COVID-19 pandemic stretched public health resources while simultaneously exposing vulnerabilities in cybersecurity as health systems faced ransomware attacks. This period represents a pivotal moment in shaping a "Strategic Society" capable of withstanding both internal and external threats.

## Building Resilience Through Collaboration

To build resilience, governments must take the lead by establishing robust legal frameworks and fostering cooperation across industries. This collaboration should extend beyond traditional boundaries to encompass all sectors of society. Historically, compartmentalized approaches were effective for organizing information around specific threats; however, today’s challenges necessitate a more integrated response.

## The Complexity of Governance

Using metaphors such as the red and blue pills from The Matrix, we can illustrate the complex choices faced regarding critical infrastructure. Awareness has evolved from simplistic binaries to a more nuanced understanding of governance—one that requires flattening the curve of misinformation and adapting to new realities.

## Future Directions for Critical Infrastructure

As strategies for protecting critical infrastructure are developed, it is essential to anticipate areas that may require unexpected adaptations. Systems deemed nationally significant will need strategic protection as they expand. Rather than focusing solely on internal assessments, there should be an outward expansion of ideas and practices that address these evolving challenges.
