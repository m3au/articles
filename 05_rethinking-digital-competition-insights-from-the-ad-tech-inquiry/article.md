The digital landscape has undergone significant transformations, especially in light of recent global challenges. This article examines the findings and proposals from the Ad Tech Inquiry, emphasizing the need for a new approach to competition policy in the era of Big Tech.

## Strategic Overview

The year 2020 marked a pivotal moment for humanity, highlighting the interconnectedness of global supply chains and the impact of climate change and pandemics. As these challenges unfolded, they reshaped our understanding of governance and economic structures. The internet has evolved into a critical social infrastructure, fundamentally altering how societies operate and govern themselves.

## The Role of Advertising

Advertising is integral to the functioning of the internet, influencing not only economic activities but also political organization. As data becomes a vital resource, the dynamics of competition have shifted. Traditional models of capitalism and communism are no longer sufficient to describe this new landscape; instead, we find ourselves in an era characterized by "vectoralism," where control over data flows is paramount.

## The Challenge for Regulators

Regulatory bodies face unique challenges in this new environment. The existing tools for competition policy are rooted in outdated models that do not adequately address the complexities of digital economies. Regulatory authorities must adapt their strategies to account for dynamic competition rather than static frameworks.

## Proposals for Change

1. Data Portability and Interoperability: While this proposal aims to enhance consumer consent, it may not significantly benefit users if data anonymization remains weak.

2. Data Separation Mechanisms: Instead of focusing solely on vertical integration concerns, regulators should encourage structural diversification to foster competition.

3. Managing Conflicts of Interest: Addressing self-preferencing in ad tech services requires a nuanced approach that considers vertical non-market use of data.

4. Voluntary Industry Standards: The effectiveness of voluntary codes is questionable; instead, regulators should pursue rigorous enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.

5. Common Transaction IDs: While this proposal aims to improve transparency, simply pricing data may not alleviate consumers' privacy concerns.

6. Common User IDs: Although this measure seeks to enhance privacy protections, it is not a comprehensive solution for long-term challenges related to consent and security.

## Temporary Conclusion

Regulators must balance short-term benefits with long-term consumer welfare. Current regulations often favor large players who can adapt quickly, potentially stifling innovation from smaller competitors. By focusing on intellectual property controls rather than merely pricing consumer data, regulators can encourage investment in innovation.

## Addressing Market Power

The focus on major players like Google overlooks other significant entities in the digital landscape, such as Tencent. The dominance of such companies raises concerns about market power and regulatory oversight. It is crucial for regulators to recognize that market share does not equate to traditional monopoly power; instead, demand and supply dynamics operate differently in digital economies.

## A Call for Innovation

To foster a competitive digital environment, regulators should prioritize innovation alongside market control. This approach will help create diverse ecosystems that can address both continental and planetary challenges effectively. By rethinking competition policy in light of these insights, we can better navigate the complexities of the digital age.
