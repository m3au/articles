What are Tokens?
Tokens are digital assets created on a blockchain. There are two main types:
Fungible Tokens (like ERC-20): These are like regular money. Each token is the same as another. Think of them like dollars or bitcoins.
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs, like ERC-721): These are unique items. Each token is different from another. Think of them like collectibles or artworks.
Testing Tokens
When you want to make sure these tokens work correctly, you need to test them. But because they're different, the way you test them is also different.

Testing Fungible Tokens (ERC-20)
Interchangeable: All tokens are the same, so you test if you can send and receive them easily.
Balance Checks: Make sure the right amounts are being sent and received.
Transfers: Ensure tokens move from one account to another correctly.
Testing Non-Fungible Tokens (ERC-721)
Unique Items: Each token is different, so you need to check their unique properties.
Ownership: Test who owns which token and if ownership can be transferred.
Metadata: Each token might have extra information (like an image or description). Make sure this data is correct.
Tools for Testing
Truffle: A framework for developing and testing smart contracts.
Mocha: A JavaScript test framework that can be used with Truffle for writing tests.
Why Test?
Testing ensures that the tokens work as expected and are secure, preventing any potential issues when they are used in real-world applications.

In summary, testing fungible and non-fungible tokens involves different steps because fungible tokens are like regular money (all the same), while non-fungible tokens are like unique collectibles (each one is different).

Certainly! Here's a simplified table comparing the testing aspects of fungible and non-fungible tokens:

| Aspect                | Fungible Tokens (ERC-20)                         | Non-Fungible Tokens (ERC-721)                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Interchangeability**| All tokens are identical and interchangeable.    | Each token is unique and not interchangeable.     |
| **Balance Checks**    | Verify correct amounts are sent and received.    | Not applicable (focus on individual token ownership). |
| **Transfers**         | Ensure tokens move correctly between accounts.   | Ensure ownership transfers correctly between accounts. |
| **Unique Properties** | Not applicable.                                  | Verify each token's unique properties and metadata. |
| **Ownership**         | Not a primary focus (more about balances).       | Verify who owns which specific token.             |
| **Metadata**          | Not applicable.                                  | Ensure the accuracy of additional data (e.g., images, descriptions). |

This table highlights the key differences in testing between fungible and non-fungible tokens.
